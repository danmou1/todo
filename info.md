# 1. Front End:

- **User Interface (UI):**    
    - Create a simple and intuitive design for your TODO app.
- **Task Input and Display:**
    - Implement basic functionality to add and display tasks.
- **User Authentication:**
    - If applicable, consider adding user authentication later. Start with a basic version and enhance it as needed.

# 2. Back End:

- **Server Setup:**
    - Set up your Node.js server with Express to handle basic HTTP requests.
- **Database Integration (PostgreSQL):**
    - Connect your Node.js backend to a PostgreSQL database.
    - Create a basic table to store task data.
- **API Endpoints:**
    - Implement basic API endpoints for adding and retrieving tasks.
- **Template Engine (EJS):**
    - Integrate EJS for server-side rendering of basic task lists.

# 3. Front End (Continued):

- **Enhance Task Functionality:**
    - Implement editing and deleting tasks.
    - Add dynamic updates to the task list.
- **Refine UI:**
    - Enhance the UI based on the additional functionality.

# 4. Back End (Continued):

- **Refine API Endpoints:**
    - Enhance API endpoints to support editing and deleting tasks.
- **Error Handling:**
    - Implement error handling for edge cases.

# 5. HTTP Server (nginx):

- **Set Up nginx:**
    - Configure nginx as a reverse proxy for your Node.js application.
    - Implement basic static file serving.
- **SSL/TLS Configuration:**
    - Add SSL/TLS for secure communication.

# 6. General Considerations:

- **Testing:**
    - Start with basic unit tests for critical functions and expand over time.
- **Security:**
    - Implement basic security measures from the start and refine as needed.
- **Documentation:**
    - Begin documenting your code and API endpoints.

# 7. Front End (Finalization):

- **Complete UI:**
    - Finalize the UI based on the full functionality of the app.

# 8. Deployment:

- **Deploy the App:**
    - Choose a hosting service or cloud platform for deployment.
    - Deploy your application and ensure it's accessible.

# 9. Monitoring and Logging:

- **Set Up Monitoring and Logging:**
    - Implement basic monitoring and logging for error tracking and performance metrics.

# 10. Final Enhancements:

- **Load Balancing (Optional):**
    - If needed, consider load balancing for scalability.
    - Implement any remaining optional features or improvements.
