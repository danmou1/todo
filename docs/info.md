    - If applicable, consider adding user authentication later. Start with a basic version and enhance it as needed.

# 2. Back End:

- **Server Setup:**
    - Set up your Node.js server with Express to handle basic HTTP requests.
- **Database Integration (PostgreSQL):**
    - Connect your Node.js backend to a PostgreSQL database.
    - Create a basic table to store task data.
- **API Endpoints:**
    - Implement basic API endpoints for adding and retrieving tasks.
- **Template Engine (EJS):**
    - Integrate EJS for server-side rendering of basic task lists.

# 3. Front End (Continued):
z
- **Enhance Task Functionality:**
    - Implement editing and deleting tasks.
    - Add dynamic updates to the task list.
- **Refine UI:**
    - Enhance the UI based on the additional functionality.

# 4. Back End (Continued):

- **Refine API Endpoints:**
    - Enhance API endpoints to support editing and deleting tasks.
