# 09/01/2024 0AM -> 4AM:
- Spent the day reading documentation from the stack, many of the tools are alien to me, and the scale of the project overwhelmed regarding where I should start.
- For now, I've decided to focus on creating a basic front-end, while still reading postgre documentation. 
- I have also separated the tasks — using a short GPT prompt — in [this file](info.md).

- figuring out postgres

# 15/01/2024 9PM -> 0AM

# 16/01/2024 8PM -> 0AM
- figuring out the db structure
- messing with sql scripts
- as I cloned with https, I couldn't commit in time to appear as 16/01 and had to troubleshoot it. turns out I just had to change the remote address.

- I will refactor the entirety of the views

# 30/01/2024 11PM -> 2:30AM
- still learning ejs things
- now the form renders in place of the table through hiding it in styling, instead of linking to another page

- somewhat refactored views

# 31/01/2024 4:30PM -> 5:30PM / 7PM -> 10:00PM
